# Julia-sets
A program to visualize Julia sets (from complex analysis)

If you start Main class, you will get a set of 441 images of different Julia sets (where C = [-1 .. 1] + i * [-1 .. 1] with step 0.1)
You have to wait about one minute to generate these images, then you can find them in folder Images.
Also you can find them there right now.

You can read more about Julia sets [there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set)
